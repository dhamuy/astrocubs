Project Name: astroCubs

Application Description: Website for bite-sized astronomy fun facts. Makes space more accessible by offering digestible astronomy photography with educational facts. Users can view random images/facts, daily featured content, and save favorites.

Features + Tools/Technologies:
- Nasa API: allows us to access images, description and additional information
- Build user input to request randomized list of images/info
- Build user input to specify a date range that they'd like to access images/info from
- Have user accounts store and access a user's favorite images/info
- Use React and javascript/typescript to build frontend and handling user input
- Use Node.js and Express to store and retrie user data, connect to the database, and manage API routes
- Use Firebase authentication for user sign in (this is a reach/optional goal)

Timeline: Build frontend on 4/28, build backend to store user info 4/30, connect to API and finish up 5/1. Pair programming for the whole project.
